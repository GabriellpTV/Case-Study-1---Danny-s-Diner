3. What was the first item from the menu purchased by each customer?

To get the first item purchased by each customer, the returned values need to have:

1 - Customer ID
2 -Product name
3 - When it was purchased

We can achieve this in two ways:

# 1 Filter the search by the earliest date

SELECT sales.customer_id, menu.product_name, MIN(sales.order_date)
FROM sales
JOIN menu ON sales.product_id = menu.product_id
WHERE sales.order_date = (
    SELECT MIN(order_date)
    FROM sales
    WHERE product_id = menu.product_id
)
GROUP BY customer_id, product_name

First, we define the columns to be returned: customer ID, product name, and when the purchase was made. To get all the information, we perform a JOIN between the sales and menu tables where the product IDs are equal.

With this, we can filter by the date where it is equal to the earliest date present in the order_date column. Then we just group by customer_id and product_name.

Since on the first visit of customer A, they made two purchases, two products purchased will be returned.

# 2 Create a CTE

We create a CTE with the addition of a new column, where we order the orders by date for each customer_id.

WITH ordered_sales AS (
	SELECT
		customer_id,
        product_id,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY order_date) AS sale_order
	FROM sales
)

This way, we have the order of purchase for each product.

Then, we perform a query to get the customer ID and the name of the product purchased.

SELECT ordered_sales.customer_id, menu.product_name
FROM ordered_sales
JOIN menu ON ordered_sales.product_id = menu.product_id
WHERE sale_order = 1;

After selecting the columns, we perform a JOIN between the ordered_sales and menu tables where the product IDs 
are equal. Finally, we filter to ensure the query result is the first one in sale_order.
