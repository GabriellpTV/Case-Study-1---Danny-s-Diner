9. If each $1 spent equates to 10 points and sushi has a 2x points multiplier - how many points would each customer have?

First, we create a CTE to calculate the number of points. To do this, we join the sales and menu tables where the product IDs are equal.
Then, I performed a CASE, where if the product name is sushi, I make the points equal to price x 20, and if not, the points are price x 10.

WITH sales_points AS (
	SELECT
		sales.customer_id,
        sales.order_date,
        sales.product_id,
        menu.product_name,
        menu.price,
        CASE
			WHEN menu.product_name = 'sushi' THEN menu.price * 20
            ELSE menu.price * 10
		END AS points
        FROM sales
		JOIN menu ON sales.product_id = menu.product_id
)

Finally, I made a select to get only the columns customer_id and summed the number of points per customer_id.

SELECT 
	customer_id,
	SUM(points) AS total_points
FROM sales_points
GROUP BY customer_id
