10. In the first week after a customer joins the program (including their join date) they earn 2x points on all items, not just sushi - 
how many points do customer A and B have at the end of January?

Similar to the previous question, we first create a CTE to calculate the points, but with a difference in how these points are calculated.

WITH sales_points AS (
	SELECT
		sales.customer_id,
        sales.order_date,
        sales.product_id,
        menu.product_name,
        menu.price,
        CASE
			WHEN menu.product_name = 'sushi' THEN menu.price * 20
            WHEN sales.customer_id = members.customer_id AND sales.order_date >= members.join_date AND sales.order_date < members.join_date + 7 THEN menu.price * 20
            ELSE menu.price * 10
		END AS points
        FROM sales
		JOIN menu ON sales.product_id = menu.product_id
        JOIN members ON sales.customer_id = members.customer_id
)

In our CASE statement, we set the rule to apply the multiplier based on the join_date to capture the first week after the customer joins, in 
addition to sushi. Also, the JOIN is an inner join because we do not want the data for Customer C, as they are not a member. Finally, we perform a simple 
select that retrieves the customer_id and sums the points, ordering by customer_id.

SELECT 
    customer_id,
    SUM(points) AS total_points
FROM sales_points
WHERE MONTH(order_date) IN (1)
GROUP BY customer_id
ORDER BY customer_id
