What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?
To answer this question, we must keep in mind that the query should return the total for each customer individually. In other words, each customer should appear only once. Additionally, all the amounts spent by the customer should be summed up to get the total amount. Considering the architecture of our tables, we don't have the necessity/possibility to calculate this total amount without the expenses.

First, we define the columns we want to show, which are customer_id and total amount. With this in mind, the following query was elaborated:

SELECT sales.customer_id, sum(menu.price) AS total_amount
FROM sales
JOIN menu ON sales.product_id = menu.product_id
GROUP BY sales.customer_id
ORDER BY total_amount DESC; 

After selecting the columns, I performed a join between the sales and menu tables where the product ids are the same, so that we can:

Count the quantity of each product purchased
Know the price of each product
Sum the product price by the quantity purchased
With this, we group everything by customer_id and order from the highest value to the lowest.
