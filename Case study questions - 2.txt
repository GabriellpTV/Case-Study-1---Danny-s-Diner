2. How many days has each customer visited the restaurant?

o answer this question, we need to keep in mind that the query should return the user ID and the number of visits.

For this, we can use the following query:

SELECT customer_id, COUNT(DISTINCT order_date) AS number_of_visits
FROM sales
GROUP BY customer_id

By selecting the column with the user ID, we can count the number of visits made. To do this, we use COUNT() and DISTINCT to count each unique visit date that appears in the table.

Finally, we group by the user ID.
