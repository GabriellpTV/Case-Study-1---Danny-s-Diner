4. What is the most purchased item on the menu and how many times was it purchased by all customers?

To answer this question, we need to select the product name and the quantity of sales across all customers. For this, we join the sales 
and menu tables on the product IDs.

SELECT menu.product_name, COUNT(sales.product_id) AS sales_quantity
FROM sales
JOIN menu ON sales.product_id = menu.product_id
GROUP BY product_name
ORDER BY 
  sales_quantity DESC
LIMIT 1;

After that, I grouped the results by the number of sales in descending order. However, if we do just that, the query result will return all the products common 
to both the sales and menu tables, along with their sales quantities. So, I added a limit of one row; this way, the query will only return 
the highest value. In other words, the most sold product and its name.
