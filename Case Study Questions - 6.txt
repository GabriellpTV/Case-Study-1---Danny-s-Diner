6. Which item was purchased first by the customer after they became a member?

To answer this question, the first piece of information we need is when each customer became a member. After this, we 
need to find all the sales that happened after the join date. For this, I create a CTE to show us this information:

WITH member_sales AS (
    SELECT sales.customer_id, sales.order_date, sales.product_id, members.join_date
    FROM sales
    JOIN members ON sales.customer_id = members.customer_id
    WHERE sales.order_date >= members.join_date
)

After that, I perform a query to find the columns customer_id, order_date, and product_id where the order_date is the earliest:

SELECT customer_id, order_date, product_id
FROM member_sales
WHERE (customer_id, order_date) IN (
    SELECT customer_id, MIN(order_date)
    FROM member_sales
    GROUP BY customer_id
);
