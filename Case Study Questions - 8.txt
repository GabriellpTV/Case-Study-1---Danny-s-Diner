8. What is the total items and amount spent for each member before they became a member?

For this, I create a CTE with the non-member sales (using the same logic as in the previous questions). The difference is a new column quantity 
with the COUNT for the product IDs. After this, I do a JOIN between these non-member sales and the menu, so we can get the price for the products.

WITH non_member_sales AS (
    SELECT 
    sales.customer_id, 
    sales.product_id, 
    COUNT(sales.product_id) as quantity,
    menu.price
    FROM sales
    JOIN members ON sales.customer_id = members.customer_id
    JOIN menu ON sales.product_id = menu.product_id
	WHERE sales.order_date < members.join_date
    GROUP BY customer_id, product_id, price
)

Then, we select the customer_id, sum the quantity of items, and sum the price multiplied by the quantity of items to get the amount_spent.

SELECT 
    customer_id, 
    SUM(quantity) AS total_items, 
    SUM(price * quantity) AS amount_spent
FROM non_member_sales
GROUP BY customer_id
ORDER BY customer_id
